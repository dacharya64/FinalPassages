Data Vis for Final Passages

This is a visualization of a dataset from the Final Passages project, detailing slave voyages within in the Americas from the years 1652-1812. 

This visualization uses a reduced version of the dataset, showing voyages from Jamaica to various American locations. 

This visualization is created in a Jupyter notebook to allow you to see how I visualize the data and edit the code to create your own visualizations.
